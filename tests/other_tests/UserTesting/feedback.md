## Operate Cohorts 
__Argyro__
Compared 
1292 : SNHL over 55 female 
1288 : SNHL less 55 female 

expected not to overlap
overlap bcs missing "firts time diagnose"

Operation may be confused with medical-operations

what is an upsetplot

Operations not intuitive at first 

AND-IN not intuitive, both
NOT-IN make no sense to combine with others

More like Atlas, same wording. 
__Elisa__
selected entry cohorts 

click button to compute calculation

NOT-IN is not evident that has to be combined 

Can we change the names ??



__Gregorio__
first the upset plot  ??

the not is snot intuitive at all 

It does not appear 

he knows the upset plot 

## What else to do 
__Argyro__

__Gregorio__



## Atlas 
__Argyro__
- build concept set with exclude, 
- mixing Atlas cohort definition with concept set 
- overlap bcs missing "first time diagnose"

# over all notes
- building an app is like making a presentation. It is not about showing the information, but building a story. Make each step on the process on the correct order and with the correct wording.
