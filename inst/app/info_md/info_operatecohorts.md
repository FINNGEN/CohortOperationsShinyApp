This tab allows to create a new cohort by operating the cohorts in the *CohortOperations*'s Workbench. 


#### New cohort's entry and exit

The first step is to select the cohorts that will define the COHORT_START_DATE and COHORT_END_DATE in the **Result cohort**.
However, if the **Result cohort** do not need this information, this step can be omitted.

By default the new cohort's COHORT_START_DATE will be the earliest COHORT_START_DATE in all the cohorts selected in this section. 
However, this can be change to "latest" or to "all the events".  "all the events" includes allows multiple the same patient to enter multiple times at different points in time.  


####  New cohort's patients 
Patients in the cohorts selected on the previous step can be further filtered by 
dragging cohorts or operations that complete the sentence started in this section. 

**New cohorts's name** descrives how the new cohort will be build. 
Whey you are satisfied with the built, click "Create new cohort"

#### Result cohort
If the bulding sentece is correct, a new cohort will appear under **Result cohort**. 
Moreover an upset-plot helps you to visually validate the operation. 

Once we have the desired **Result cohort**, it can be copied to the *CohortOperations*'s Workbench.
